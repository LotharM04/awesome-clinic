## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 11.0 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. This project uses [Expo](https://expo.io) to work around this.

## ðŸŽ‰ Running the app
